# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

odit is currently a work-in-progress (WIP) project. We aim to support the latest version of libgit2 (vendored at commit 58d9363 as of this writing). Use the main branch for the most up-to-date security features, but note that as a WIP, no versions are formally "supported" yet. Check for updates regularly.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in odit, please report it responsibly. Do not open a public issue for security concerns.

- **Preferred Method**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature. Go to the repository's Security tab and click "Report a vulnerability" to submit a draft security advisory.
- **Alternative**: Email the maintainer at [your-email@example.com] with details. Include a description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce, and any potential impact.

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours, investigate promptly, and keep you updated on progress. If the issue is confirmed, we will release a patch as soon as possible. You will be credited in the advisory unless you request anonymity.

For more details on GitHub's security features, see the official documentation. This policy is adapted from common best practices for open-source repositories.
